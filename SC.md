  3.  Reconnect all the cables and hoses (leave water hoses until turbo is pumping properly)                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
  4.  Turn water back on                                                                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
      -   Move the gonio to “Cs+ position”

YOU MUST FOLLOW THE PROCEDURE FOR BRINGING UP A NEW CS+ SOURCE BEFORE
USING

[[[]{#OLE_LINK9 .anchor}]{#OLE_LINK8 .anchor}]{#OLE_LINK7
.anchor}**Procedure for Bringing up a new Caesium Source**

When bringing up a new caesium source, patience is the key. It can take
up to a few days to fully bring a new source up to working conditions.
The main indicators that must be watched while starting a new source are
the source chamber vacuum and the FCp current. The vacuum is especially
important. Ideally, it should be in the 10^-7^ to the 10^-6^ range. If
it gets up to the high 10^-5^ range (eg 9x10^-5^), then everything must
be put to zero and one must wait for the vacuum to decrease again.

1.  Turn on HV if you haven’t already done it

2.  First put the vacuum controls in manual mode. This will allow the
    user to work at conditions in the source chamber up to 10^-5^ Torr.
    If you don’t do this when the vacuum reaches 1.2 x10^-5^ the red Cs+
    safety light on the vacuum window will come on and then you will
    have to restart the computer or do a param connect to be able to
    apply more current. If all the currents, leak and HV read zero in
    real measure you have lost communication.

3.  Once the vacuum is down to the 10^-7^ range, set the high voltage to
    the source to 8000V, and check if there is arcing occurs.

    -   If there is arcing, it should open source again and check all
        the cables and connections

    -   If there is no arcing, set HV = 700 V ( if HV&lt;500V, the Cs
        source will not start)

4.  Start heating the ionizer.

    -   Start at 0.01mA then 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.12, 0.15, 0.17, 0.2.
        Watch the vacuum on the multi-gauge controller as it will
        increase when the ionizer is started.

    -   It may take 1-3 days to get past the 0.01mA stage as the ioniser
        current will need to be put back to 0 mA each time the vacuum
        gets to 5x10^-5^ Torr.

    -   Once the vacuum stops increasing and drops down to the low
        10^-6^ range, increase the ionizer to the next step. When the
        current reaches 0.02 mA the green light on the source chassis
        labelled “ionizer heater” should be on.

5.  Once the vacuum is staying in the 10^-6^ range, you can switch the
    vacuum controls back to auto.

6.  Continue increasing ionizer by small increments (i.e. 0.2 mA --&gt;
    0.25 --&gt; 0.3 --&gt; 0.35 --&gt; etc.), always waiting until
    vacuum stops increasing and begins to drop

7.  When the ionizer reaches 0.7 mA, incrementally increase (500V steps)
    the high voltage to 8000V. There may be some outgassing. When
    7000-8000V is reached, some current may be seen in FCp.

8.  Resume increasing the ionizer. When the ionizer reaches about 1 mA
    to 1.1 mA, let it bake at that current for an hour, keeping an eye
    on the vacuum. If it is near the end of the day, you can leave the
    ionizer to bake at this setting overnight

9.  When ionizer value reaches about 1.3 mA, start to bring up the
    reservoir in a similar incremental manner starting at 0.01, 0.02,
    0.05 etc. This will probably outgas like the ioniser but should be
    quicker.

10. When the reservoir hits 0.2 mA, the green light on the source
    chassis labelled “reservoir heater” will come on. At this point,
    there should be more current in Fcp, a few nA

11. Wait until the vacuum begins to decrease as well as the Fcp current
    before increasing the reservoir current further.

12. Incrementally bring the reservoir current up to about 0.3 mA (or
    leave at 0.2 if the current is fine) and let it sit there. The Fcp
    current at this point will be very unstable, so wait until it levels
    out

13. Final target values for the source are 1.7 mA for the ionizer, 0.15
    mA for the reservoir, and 8000V for the high voltage
